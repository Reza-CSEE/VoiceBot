# VoiceBot – NLP & LLM-based Conversational Assistant

## 📌 Overview

VoiceBot is a **speech-enabled conversational assistant** that leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and AWS cloud infrastructure** to provide real-time, voice-driven interactions.
It can retrieve information, automate tasks, and respond naturally to user queries.

Key features:

* 🎤 Voice recognition using **SpeechRecognition** & **sounddevice**
* 🤖 Intelligent response generation with **LLMs (OpenAI API)**
* ☁️ Scalable backend using **AWS Lambda** + **AWS RDS (MySQL)**
* 📊 SQL-based user interaction analysis for behavior tracking

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn
* **Libraries:** SpeechRecognition, soundfile, pymysql, stripe, openai
* **Cloud Services:** AWS Lambda (serverless), AWS RDS (MySQL)
* **Database:** MySQL / PostgreSQL
* **Tools:** Git, Linux

---

## 🚀 Features

* Convert **speech → text → response** seamlessly
* Perform **information retrieval** and task automation
* Optimize query understanding using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
* SQL-based logging and **user drop-off detection** for system improvement
* Reduced latency by **40%** with serverless pipelines
* Increased task success rate by **23%** and user satisfaction by **27%**
